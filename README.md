# cmlart

Cade's Machine Learning ART (CMLART) is a collection of utilities for doing AI-assisted (or, as I have started calling it, human-assisted) art. It contains some implementations of basic algorithms such as deep dream (based on InceptionNet), as well as some GAN-based approaches

## Install/Setup

To install requirements, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you don't want to install this package, you can run export the path to `PYTHONPATH`. For example, if you cloned the repo in `~/projects`, add `export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/projects/cmlart"` to your shell (for example, in your `~/.bashrc`)
